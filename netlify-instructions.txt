How to Deploy Your Mother's Day Website to Netlify without Git:

1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. Create a ZIP file of your entire Mother's Day website folder
3. Drag and drop the ZIP file onto the Netlify Drop zone
4. Wait for the upload to complete
5. Your site will be live at a random Netlify subdomain (e.g., random-name-123456.netlify.app)
6. You can set a custom subdomain in the Netlify site settings

This method doesn't require Git installation or command line knowledge.
