# Complete GitHub Pages Deployment Instructions

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. Open your web browser and go to [GitHub](https://github.com)
2. Sign in to your account (or create one if you don't have one)
3. Click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository"
4. Fill in the repository details:
   - Repository name: `mothers-day-tribute` (or any name you prefer)
   - Description: "A beautiful Mother's Day tribute website with music and animations"
   - Visibility: Public
   - Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
5. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push Your Local Repository to GitHub

1. After creating the repository, you'll see a page with instructions
2. Run the `github_setup.bat` file in your project folder:
   - Navigate to your project folder in File Explorer
   - Double-click the `github_setup.bat` file
   - When prompted, enter your GitHub repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/mothers-day-tribute.git`)
   - Wait for the script to finish pushing your files

## Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Settings" (tab at the top of the repository)
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Pages"
4. Under "Build and deployment", select:
   - Source: "GitHub Actions"
5. GitHub will automatically detect the workflow file we created and use it for deployment

## Step 4: Wait for Deployment

1. Go to the "Actions" tab on your repository
2. You should see a workflow running for your repository
3. Wait for this workflow to complete (it should take 1-2 minutes)

## Step 5: Access Your Website

1. After the workflow completes successfully, return to the "Settings" > "Pages" section
2. You should see a message saying "Your site is published at https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/mothers-day-tribute/"
3. Click on this URL to view your deployed website

## Making Changes

If you want to make changes to your website after deployment:

1. Make your changes to the files locally
2. Commit your changes with Git:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of your changes"
   ```
3. Push your changes to GitHub:
   ```
   git push origin master
   ```
4. GitHub Actions will automatically redeploy your website

## Troubleshooting

### Music Not Playing
- Make sure the audio file path is correct
- Check that the audio file was properly uploaded to GitHub
- Remember that some browsers require user interaction before playing music

### Images Not Loading
- Check that image paths are correct and relative
- Verify that all image files were properly uploaded to GitHub

### GitHub Pages Not Updating
- Check the "Actions" tab to see if there are any errors with the deployment workflow
- If there are errors, review them and make the necessary corrections

### GitHub Authorization
- If you're asked for credentials when pushing to GitHub, use:
  - Username: Your GitHub username
  - Password: Use a personal access token (not your password)
  - You can create a personal access token at: GitHub > Settings > Developer Settings > Personal access tokens
